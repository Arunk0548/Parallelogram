# Parallelogram
Parallelogram Madness

Write a program that accepts as input from the user 4 coordinates, and gives as output, “The coordinates form the vertices of a parallelogram” if the coordinates form a parallelogram, and if not, the output should be, “The coordinates do not form the vertices of a parallelogram.” 

Note: you must specify an order in which the coordinates need to be taken so that they form a parallelogram. 

Sample input: 
(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

Sample output: 
The coordinates form a parallelogram in the following order: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (1,0)
